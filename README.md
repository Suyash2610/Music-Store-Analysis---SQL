This project involves querying a music store database to answer various questions about the business. The dataset contains information about employees, customers, invoices, tracks, and more. The project is divided into three sets of questions with varying levels of difficulty.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project includes tables for Employees, Customers, Invoices, Tracks, Artists, and more. It is a SQL database designed for a fictional music store.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three sets of questions, each progressively more challenging.

### Set 1 - Easy

1. **Senior Most Employee by Job Title**: Find the senior most employee based on job title.
2. **Countries with the Most Invoices**: Identify the countries with the highest number of invoices.
3. **Top 3 Values of Total Invoice**: Determine the top 3 values of the total invoice amount.
4. **City with the Best Customers**: Identify the city with the highest sum of invoice totals.
5. **Best Customer**: Find the customer who has spent the most money.

### Set 2 - Moderate

1. **Rock Music Listeners**: Retrieve the email, first name, last name, and genre of all rock music listeners, ordered alphabetically by email.
2. **Top 10 Rock Bands**: List the artist names and total track counts of the top 10 rock bands.
3. **Tracks Longer Than Average**: Return track names with a song length longer than the average, ordered by song length.

### Set 3 - Advanced

1. **Customer Spending by Artist**: Calculate the total amount spent by each customer on artists and return customer name, artist name, and total spent.
2. **Most Popular Genre by Country**: Determine the most popular music genre for each country based on the highest amount of purchases.
3. **Top-Spending Customers by Country**: Find the customer who spent the most on music for each country, including shared top spenders.

## Getting Started

To run these SQL queries, you need access to a SQL database that contains the music store data. You can use any SQL database management tool like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or others to execute these queries.

## Usage

You can use the provided SQL queries in your database management tool to analyze the music store data and answer the questions outlined in each set. Each question has its SQL query for reference.
